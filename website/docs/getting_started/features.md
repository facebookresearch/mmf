MMF is powered by PyTorch and features:

- **Model Zoo**: Reference implementations for state-of-the-art vision and language models including [VisualBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03557), [ViLBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02265), [M4C](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06258) (SoTA on TextVQA and TextCaps), [Pythia](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09956) (VQA 2018 challenge winner), and many others. See the full list of projects in MMF [here](../notes/projects.md).
- **Multi-Tasking**: Support for training on multiple datasets together.
- **Datasets**: Includes built-in support for various datasets including VQA, VizWiz, TextVQA, Visual Dialog and COCO Captioning. Running a single command automatically downloads and sets up the dataset for you.
- **Modules**: Provides implementations of many commonly used layers in vision and language.
- **Distributed**: Support for distributed training using DistributedDataParallel. With our hyperparameter sweep support, you can scale your model to any number of nodes.
- **Unopinionated**: Unopinionated about the dataset and model implementations built on top of it.
- **Customization**: Custom losses, metrics, scheduling, optimizers, tensorboard; suits all your custom needs.
